Value for the immediate parameter(one before the last data):
0=No parameters
1,2,3=imm8/16/32 parameters(imm32 also used for ptr16:16, with low 16-bits being IP, high 16-bits being CS).
5-7=See above(1-3), but restricted to modrm reg<2.
8=imm16(stack size)+imm8(depth) (ENTER)
9=imm64(ptr16:32 as immediate, first 32-bit(low) then 16-bit(high 32 bits)). Loads into imm64 as well as imm32(offset)/immw(segment).
A=imm16/32(depending on address size). Used with opcodes A0-A3. Loads into immaddr32.
